# AutoRecorder
This script records a timed set of time of a zoom meeting with Open Broadcast Studio (OBS)

## **prerequisites**

* Install Zoom, log in and ensure:
    * join call with audio is set automatically(to allow sound recording)
    * join meeting in full screen is set automatically(optional)

* Install OBS and ensure:
    * OBS filepath is changed or id the same as in script
    * zoom is selected to be recorded in OBS already(window recording -> zoom.exe -> match window title window 1903)

Set zoom link in string and set when and for how long to record the meeting in appropriate places.

**I forked this script for myself, for my own use and unexpected errors may pop up feel free to help me correct that.**
